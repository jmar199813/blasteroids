This project took me hours and hours and hours to complete. I would think about improving it or fixing a bug at all hours of the day.

It really taught me a lot about JavaScript with such a relatively small project.

I was essentially bored out of my mind watching tutorials/doing the freecodecamp JavaScript course. So I chose to do something on my own instead.


This is the project I was most proud of accomplishing. It took a lot of troubleshooting and knowledge of JavaScript to get this to work.

Unfortunetely I didn't use Git when i created this so I don't have all the version controls.

I was so dumb and naive.

My way of version control was to copy the code into notepad before I made changes so I could always revert back to the prevous version if I had messsed up bad.

Now I know how to use Git and it would have been much easier for version control.

After this project I moved onto React and it went fairly well.

Live and let learn I guess.
